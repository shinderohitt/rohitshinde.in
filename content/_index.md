### Rohit Shinde

I am a software engineer by profession. I have worked with **distributed systems**, dealing with large scale traffic. I have led a team, worked as an individual contributor, and a consultant. I have worked across **multiple domains**, with **different tech stacks**. I am a **software generalist**, and pick up tools and languages based on the problem at hand. Here's my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZ3IXUG7qe-HxOIKYyszd-gcJnNOKPwPCG700-UfF7Q/edit?usp=sharing).

I am **curious** by nature, and like to understand systems. Be it technical, sociological, or biological. When not working I read, scroll through /r/funny, or go on walks.
